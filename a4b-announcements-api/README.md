# :rocket: Using the Amazon Alexa for Business (A4B) API to send announcements :rocket:

## Introduction

This sample code shows how to [Send Announcements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/a4b/latest/ag/announcements.html) to rooms in A4B using the [JavaScript SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/AlexaForBusiness.html#sendAnnouncement-property).

It uses text messages, but can be extended to use SSML and / or Audio. For the rooms, I used the Key RoomName, but it can be switched to using the Room ARN, Profile ARN, or the Profile Name

## Prerequisites

This code should be run with using AWS credentials with access granted to Alexa for Business
