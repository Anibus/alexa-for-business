# Alexa for Business Code Snippets
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/quiz-game/header._TTH_.png" />

This section of our repo includes snippets of code that illustrate how to accomplish a particular task.  Generally these do not include the entire Alexa skill but answer targeted "How Do I" type of questions that zero in on very specific work-related use cases.  For example we might show how to integrate your AWS Lambda function with backend S3 data, or provide a few lines of code showing how to have Alexa spell out a WiFi password instead of trying to speak "abc123" as a word.
