## Share your private skill templates

Congratulations!  You've successfully created and tested an Alexa for Business private skill that takes a room issue report and sends it to a chat channel in Chime, Slack, or Teams via a web-hook POST.

Now that you've published your private skill and made it available to your organization, you can further share your knowledge in a couple of different ways:

1. [Alexa for Business Forums:](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=273&start=0)  Questions and Answers on Alexa for Business can be found in the AWS Developer Forums.  This is a great opportunity for developers to share knowledge with each other.  The product team for Alexa for Business is also often on these forums to help answer questions but we encourage developers to help each other to answer questions as well.

2. [Serverless Repository:](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications)  AWS has a Serverless Repository that holds Lambda code from third party contributors.  You can upload sample Alexa skill Lambda templates to this repo, and link back to your own repository that could include the entire skill.  This is another great way to share knowledge with the community on private skills that you've developed!
