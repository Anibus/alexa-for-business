Here you'll find skill samples that are location aware using the resolveRoom API, available via the "shared device" deployment model of Alexa for Business.

If a user grants permissions to disclose their device address, an Alexa skill can discover the location of the user's device which is useful for purposes of fulfilling their request.
"Order a pizza," for example, might discover the user's address to check pricing against.

However, for enterprise skills, oftentimes the address isn't enough- for example, knowing which conference room the request is coming from may be important for a Help Desk skill.
"Tell Help Desk the projector lamp needs to be replaced," would not work.  Making the user find out what room they're in (by which time the skill may have timed out) and then speak the room name, adds unwanted friction into the experience.

Thus having the skill call resolveRoom to get the room name is often beneficial for skills that need location awareness.
(Think also, use cases involving print/copy stations, kitchen equipment, utility meters, and so on)
